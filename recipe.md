## All the steps for this recipe.

1. (MAKE SURE TO DO THIS FIRST!!!) Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together brown sugar, egg, egg yolk, and also vanilla until combined.

3. Place chocolate in a large, zipper-lock plastic bag and seal it, making sure to remove AS MUCH AIR AS POSSIBLE from the bag. Then, use a rolling pin to lightly pound the chocolate into small pieces.

4. In a small, microwave-safe bowl, combine the pounded chocolate and butter. Heat in the microwave @ 50% power until melted, 1 - 2 minutes. Use oven mitts to remove bowl from microwave (CAUTION BOWL WILL BE HOT!). Use a rubber spatula to stir chocolate mixture until well combined and shiny.

5. Add chocolate mixture to brown sugar mixture and use rubber spatula to stir until combined. Stir in flour mixture until no dry flour is visible. Let dough sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.

6. Place sugar in 1 shallow dish & confectioners' sugar in a 2nd shallow dish.

7. Use your hands to roll dough into 12 balls (about 2 tablespoons each). Drop balls directly into shallow dish with sugar and roll to evenly coat.

8. Place dough balls on parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between balls.

9. Place baking sheet in oven. Bake cookies until puffed nd cracked and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (cookies will look raw in cracks and seem underdone), about 11 minutes.

10. Use oven mitts to remove baking sheet from oven (ask an adult for help with this.) Place baking sheet on cooling rack and let cookies cool completely on baking sheet, about 30 minutes. Serve
